**A modern, sequential Discord spam bot that automatically skips blocked bots.**  
This tool allows multiple bot tokens to send spam messages to a specified server.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Sequential execution of multiple bot tokens.  
- Automatically skips blocked bots and continues with the next one.  
- Accepts bot tokens and server ID via command line (`-t` and `--guildid`).  
- Defaults to pre-configured tokens and guild ID if none are provided.  
- Detects writable channels and lets the user choose.  
- Built with modern Python `asyncio` and `discord.py`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher  
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install discord.py
Bots must be active in the server and have these permissions:

View Channels

Send Messages

🚀 Usage
Using default tokens and guild ID:
bash
Kodu kopyala
python main.py
Using command line options:
bash
Kodu kopyala
python main.py -t TOKEN1,TOKEN2,TOKEN3 --guildid 123456789012345678
-t or --tokens → Comma-separated bot tokens

--guildid → Guild ID where bots will send messages

⚠️ Important Notes
Use only on your own test servers.

Discord may ban accounts or bots for spam or abuse.

Bots cannot join servers automatically, they must be added manually.

📌 Setup
Create bots on Discord Developer Portal and get their tokens.

Invite the bots to your server (OAuth2 → bot scope → required permissions).

Run install.bat (Windows) or install.sh (Linux/macOS) to install dependencies.

Run main.py to list channels, select one, and start the spam sequence.
